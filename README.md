TO DO as of 3/7/22

- make new pyenv and set the python version to be 2.7.0 (3.8.4 doesn't work)
  - I want to just copy the example and get it working. Doing my best to do that.
- take code from https://rapidapi.com/blog/yahoo-finance-api-python/ and place into visual studio
- find out what imports people say they have issue with and figure out if they are needed or I can use something else.
- probably don't need to print out the chart, just do something simple please.
